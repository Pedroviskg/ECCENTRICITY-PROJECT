My Scientific Initiation work at UFRGS on eccentricities of heavy ions.
This program simulates collisions of heavy ions (commonly lead and gold) and calculates the eccentricity and overlap area

To run the code please follow:
1. You need to have ROOT Framework on your computer. To download and install it, check the official website: https://root.cern/;
2. Make sure all files are in the same folder;
3. Open a terminal, go to the folder the files are and run root runall.C
4. On ROOT Framework interface, type .q and repeat step 3 (this is necessary for an issue that ROOT causes with Clang).
